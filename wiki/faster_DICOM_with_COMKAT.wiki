#summary How to accelerate DICOM reading

= Introduction =

COMKAT is a great software package developed for kinetic modeling analysis of molecular images. It comes with fast DICOM reading functions that can accelerate the DICOM reading for CGITA. 

Note: This is only good for CGITA under MATLAB. CGITA under stand-alone application cannot benefit from these functions. 

= Download COMKAT =

First, go to the [http://comkat.case.edu COMKAT website] to get COMKAT. 

= Move the files =

Under the COMKAT root folder, go to the 'ComkatImageTool' folder. Copy the files 'dcmreadfile.mexw32' and 'dcmreadfile.mexw64'. 

Paste these two files under the 'image_fun' folder.
