=== Introduction ===
This is a guide to show you how to download and set up CGITA. For description of CGITA features, refer to [CGITA_preview this page].

=== Determining how to run CGITA ===
There are two ways to run CGITA:
  # Under MATLAB - Using CGITA under CGITA gives you more flexibility in error tracing, debugging, adding new functions, etc. 
  # As a stand-alone application (SAA) - The advantage is that you do not need a MATLAB license for this. However, you will not be able to add new functions or modify the CGITA program. 

If you just need to use built-in functions of CGITA, either mode is good. These two modes are almost identical in speed and capability. 

* If you do have a MATLAB license (and it's not too old), it is recommended to use CGITA under MATLAB. If you do not own a MATLAB license, CGITA as a stand-alone application will be the only choice. *

=== Download MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) for stand-alone version of CGITA === 
<font color="red"> * If you want to run CGITA as a stand-alone application, you must install the latest version of MCR on your computer. *</font> Go to [http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html this Mathworks webpage] to download the MCR for your platform.  

=== Download the CGITA file you need === 
After you have determined whether to run it under MATLAB or as an SAA, go to the [http://code.google.com/p/cgita/downloads/list download page] to get the file you need.

=== Setting CGITA up under MATLAB === 
  # Uncompress the zip file 'CGITA_v1.0_matlab.zip' to a local drive on your computer. 
  # Open MATLAB. Go to 'File' -> 'Set path' -> 'Add with subfolders'. Then select the folder that you uncompressed CGITA to on your computer. Press OK. Press save and exit this window. 
  # Under the MATLAB command window, type 'CGITA_GUI' and enter. If the CGITA GUI pops up, the setup should have been properly done. 
  # If you wish to accelerate DICOM reading with functions included in [http://comkat.case.edu COMKAT]. Follow [faster_DICOM_with_COMKAT this page]. 

=== Setting CGITA under SAA === 
  # Uncompress the zip file (either CGITA_v1.0_win32_app.zip or CGITA_v1.0_win64_app.zip) to a local drive on your computer. 
  # Make sure MCR has been installed on your computer. 
  # Execute CGITA_saa.exe

=== User manual ===
