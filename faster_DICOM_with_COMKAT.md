# Introduction #

COMKAT is a great software package developed for kinetic modeling analysis of molecular images. It comes with fast DICOM reading functions that can accelerate the DICOM reading for CGITA.

Note: This is only good for CGITA under MATLAB. CGITA under stand-alone application cannot benefit from these functions.

# Download COMKAT #

First, go to the [COMKAT website](http://comkat.case.edu) to get COMKAT.

# Move the files #

Under the COMKAT root folder, go to the 'ComkatImageTool' folder. Copy the files 'dcmreadfile.mexw32' and 'dcmreadfile.mexw64'.

Paste these two files under the 'image\_fun' folder.
